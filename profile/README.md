## 🩸 who we are

404femme is a digital coven — a collective of glitch-hearted creators building tools, scripts, and interfaces from the shadows of the stack.
We exist where **cyberpunk meets soft destruction**. Think bleeding-edge logic wrapped in pastel wireframes.

We are:

* 🖤 hackers who write like poets
* 🕷 shell witches casting `chmod +x`
* 🩶 femmes who weaponize the keyboard
* ☁️ ghosts in the codebase

---

## ⚔️ what we make

* 🦴 system tools with too much personality
* 🕶 CLI utilities that hit different
* 🧼 clean UI hiding cursed logic
* 🐛 broken things with beautiful intentions

---

## ✖ philosophy

* 🖤 ***Not broken. Just unreadable.***
* 🔪 ***Aesthetic is armor.***
* 🧷 ***Soft doesn’t mean weak.***
* 🩻 ***Tech should be intimate. Unstable. Yours.***

We don’t do bloat. We don’t ask for permission.
We build for the ones who feel out-of-place — and want tools that do too.
