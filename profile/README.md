## 💖 who we are

404femme is a cozy collective of creative coders, cyber dreamers, and pixel witches who craft software with heart.
We blur the line between the terminal and the aesthetic — blending tech with tender energy, and fierce independence with soft sparkle 🌸🌈

* 🖼 **artful CLI tools** with a soul (like [UwUFetch](https://github.com/404femme/UwUFetch)!)
* 💻 minimalist apps with maximal vibes
* 🧪 experimental utilities, scripts, and ✨ nonsense
* 💬 tools for comfy communication, productivity, and self-expression

---

## 🌱 philosophy

We believe in:

* ✿ **cute software** that feels good to use
* 🛸 **accessible tech** with magical UX
* 🧚 **soft rebellion** through code
* 🤍 **freedom, fun, and femme energy**
